# A-B-Testing-of-Mobile-Game-Cookie-Cats
As players progress through the game, they will encounter gates that require them to wait 
a certain amount of time before proceeding or making an in-app purchase. We will analyze 
the results of an A/B test in which the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 
to level 40 in this project. We will look specifically at the impact on player retention.
